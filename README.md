Calculator Application

This is a small single page project to demonstrate calculator functions using AngularJs. The Calculator look meets the styles provided in the requirement.

The application has an index page which is an HTML page for Calculator. 
It includes a script folder, which has Angular js files, a Service file, and a style sheet. 

For each button click, ReadInput(KeyId) method is being called. The method declaration is done in the Calculator controller in Calculator.js file and the implementation is done in CalculatorService.js file.

Similarly, On click of Equal to "=" button, ShowResult() method is being called. The method declaration is done in the Calculator controller in Calculator.js file and the implementation is done in the CalculatorService.js file. 


# Why Angular JS
AngularJS lets us write client-side web applications. It lets you use good old HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding. To helps to structure application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control.
